  My Accomplishments in Elementary school
  </h2>
  <p>
  When I went to James David Elementary School I was a very good student. I was on honour roll every year but only cause my uncle was the principle and so I was heavily favoured. Me and my friend Dhami Tejveer tied for an award for the most absents in the school year in grade 4 because we were in the same class and like we were best friends. That was all the awards I won and I was very sad.

  My Accomplishments in High School
  </h2>
  <p>
  I did not have any awards in any Canadian high schools because I was offered a scholarship to Hogwarts to go play quidditch. I was very sad because I had to leave my best friend Dhami Tejveer. He was sad too because I promised that both of us would drop out and be garbage men but I failed him
